A hammer will come in handy for almost all your pallet projects and more generally all your woodworking projects. Moreover, a hammer is not the most expensive tool in your pallet crafter kit and is one of the useful ones. There are several types - such as framing, roofing, drywall, ball peen, bricklayers and even sledgehammers. A curved claw hammer is a great all-around handy tool, but you may find you need more types or a different style for your body type. Hammers come in different weights, lengths, and even grip sizes.</p></div>

Table saws make quick work of ripping long lengths of pallet wood to narrower sizes. Scroll saws are great for those advanced tasks and doing decorative cutouts.<br></p>

To sum up, a saw is essential for all your woodworking projects! There are even pull saws (cuts when you pull towards you instead of with the push away from you) and can be easier to use if you have less upper body strength.<br>

Never lose your tape measure; it is an essential tool! You may find a device that does double-duty. Some rulers also function as a T-square so you can measure AND check for square assembly.<br><br><strong>Screws &amp; Nails</strong><br><br>Any pallet project needs screws &amp; nails so must be sure to get prepared and have a variety of nails and wood screws (different sizes and diameters). Some are appropriate for outdoor use (such as stainless steel or deck screws). Some are better for indoor use only, as they don't have the protective coatings or are more prone to rust. If you have to use a lot of longer screws (more than 3"), the different head styles can make a difference, such as a square or Torx style. It gives more surface area for your bit to hold onto and prevents stripping the head of the screw.<strong><br></strong><br></p>

You can start with an inexpensive, manual one. You'd need a Phillip's, and if you're recycling old hardware, you may need a flat (slotted) screwdriver too. As you start to perform more and more projects, a powered screwdriver will save you time, but more importantly, it will protect your hands and muscles. Powered screwdrivers come in different sizes and weights - so you can find one to fit your personal needs.</h3>

A drill will also be handy for any other crafting project you could have. Drills are great for creating pilot holes. Sometimes pallet wood is aged, and very dry. It'll split apart as you drive a nail or screw through it. A drill will allow you to make a hole slightly smaller than the hardware you're using, allowing the screw to hold the piece without splitting it apart. You can also use a drill to do decorative touches, such as countersinking (drilling out a funnel-shaped hole that lets the screw head to sit flush or slightly below the wood surface). This can add to a polished look.<br></p>

                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7">A sander is particularly useful to prepare pallet wood. You can use one to simply remove the very rough edges and splinters, or all the way down to fine finish work. Sanding can be part of your finish or as a preparation step before applying any treatment on it like painting or varnish. Maybe you prefer the raw aspect of the pallet wood, but a sander will come in handy for any crafting project that involves some pieces of wood. There are different types: Random-Orbital sanders, palm sanders, sanding blocks, belt sanders, disc sanders, drum sanders, and more. You can even use sanding attachments on your small rotary tools.</h3>
